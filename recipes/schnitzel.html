    <h2>Baked Chicken Schitzel</h2>
    <p>Growing up, chicken schnitzel was a classic. I decided to make this dish oven-friendly using less oil, 
        and an easier cleanup. This dish tastes great with potato salad, or mashed potatoes and a nice crisp salad. 
        Tastes great the next day cold too! It's a family-favorite! Enjoy with fresh squeezed lemon juice. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>
        <ul>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired</ul>
        <ul>6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied)</ul>
        <ul>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</ul>
        <ul>Â¾ cup all-purpose flour</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon paprika</ul>
        <ul>2 eggs, beaten</ul>
        <ul>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</ul>
        <ul>1 large lemon, zested</ul>
    </li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil. Place baking sheet in preheated oven.</ol>
        <ol>Flatten chicken breasts so they are all about 1/4-inch thick. Season chicken with salt and pepper.</ol>
        <ol>Mix flour and paprika together on a large plate. Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs and lemon zest together on a separate large plate. Dredge each chicken piece in flour mixture, then egg, and then bread crumbs mixture and set aside in 1 layer on a clean plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.</ol>
        <ol>Remove baking sheet from oven and arrange chicken in 1 layer on the sheet. Drizzle more olive oil over each piece of coated chicken.</ol>
        <ol>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue baking until no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</ol>
    </li>
